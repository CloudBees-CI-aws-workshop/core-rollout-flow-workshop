Coming soon...

In this lab we will examine external endpoints for CloudBees Core Cross Team Collaboration and explore how they can be used to provided automated and ephemeral preview environments for GitHub pull requests (PR).

You may proceed to the next lab: [*Hibernating Masters*](../hibernating-masters/hibernating-masters.md) or choose another lab on the [main page](../../README.md#workshop-labs).
