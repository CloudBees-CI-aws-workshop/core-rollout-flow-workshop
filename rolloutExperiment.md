2. On the left-hand side of the screen, click Production, and then Experiments from the expanded list.
3. Click Create a New Experiment.
4. In the pop-up, ensure the "default.sidebar" flag is selected from the drop-down menu before clicking Set Audience.
5. Right now, the sidebar is not shown because the value of the feature flag is set to False by default. We can now change the value to true. Click on the drop-down menu next to then and select True.
6. Click Update Audience.
7. Navigate back to the micro-blog and see that the sidebar is now visible.
