# Rollout Configuration as Code

Configuration as Code (CasC) allows the entire configuration of Rolloutâ€™s state to be stored as source code.

* The Rollout integration with Git code management service includes a bi-directional connection with your repository.
* If you make changes in your repository and push it to the remote origin branch, Rollout will pick these updates and update the dashboard accordingly.
* If you make changes in the dashboard, Rollout will push commits into your branches.
