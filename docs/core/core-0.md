# Workshop Tools Overview

* We will be using Zoom breakout rooms for the majority of the workshop material.
* Please use the Zoom chat to introduce yourself and if you have any questions.
* We will have a short poll where you will be able to assess your experience level in a few technical areas. Based on your responses to the poll questions you will be asked to rank your overall experience level as a **1**, **2** or a **3**, and then rename yourself in Zoom by adding that number before your name.
* After an overview of CloudBees Core you will grouped by experience level into Zoom breakout rooms.
* Once in the breakout rooms please feel free to ask questions via audio or via the Zoom. You may also use the Zoom *Nonverbal* feedback feature to raise your hand or to ask you instructor to slow down or speed up. NOTE: The chat is only broadcast to your breakout room.
