The [Cross Team Collaboration](https://docs.cloudbees.com/docs/cloudbees-core/2.204.2.2/cloud-admin-guide/cross-team-collaboration) functionality in CloudBees Core allows you to create events and listeners to trigger jobs across Core Masters. It provides a pub/sub relationship where jobs can send an event with data, and the jobs listening for it can trigger and process the data.
