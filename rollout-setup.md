# Rollout Set-Up

In this lab, we will introduce CloudBees Rollout for feature flag management. We first need to connection to the Rollout Dashboard by leveraging the appropriate SDK. This will allow us to control newly created feature flags in later lags.

# Assumptions
Need to know what their initial view will look like. Aka, what is the outcome of Pre-Requisites/Rollout sign up script

## Outline for EL
1. Get Rollout Environment Key
2. Add Key and JavaScript SDK to Code
3. Confirm Connection (Flags located in Rollout Dashboard) 

## Dashboard Set-Up and SDK Connection
1. Log in to the [Rollout dashboard](https://app.rollout.io/login) using the account created previously.
2. Within the navigation menu, located on the far left side of the dashobard, click the "App Settings" option.
3. From the resulting App Settings page, navigate to the "Environments" tab, and copy your unique key associated with the Production environment.
