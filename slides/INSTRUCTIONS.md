# Instructions on updating slides

All of the slides exist in the `slides.md` file.

To create a new page, wrap some content inside some `---` like this example below.

```markdown
---

# This is page 1

---

# This is page 2

---
```

## Styling

Styling is on the to do list, but for the time being let's focus on content. We'll come back and polish it later.
