# Core Workshop Setup

In this lab, everyone will:

* Create their own CloudBees Core Jenkins instance referred to as a [Team Master](https://docs.cloudbees.com/docs/cloudbees-core/latest/cloud-admin-guide/cje-ux).

* Create a Github Personal Access Token that you will use within Jenkins to connect Pipelines, Multibranch Pipelines, and Github Organization Projects to your Github organization and repositories.
