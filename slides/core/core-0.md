# CloudBees Assurance Program for Core
* The CloudBees Assurance Program (CAP) specifies the set of plugins, plugin versions, and plugin dependencies that are verified and trusted through integrated testing. 
* This provides greater stability and security for Core based Jenkins environments. 
* All CAP plugins are verified to be independently stable and they are tested in aggregate to ensure compatibility with each other and the Jenkins LTS version of the Core release.
